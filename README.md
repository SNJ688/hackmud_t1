T1 hackmud scripts - !! SPOILERS !!

I'm not saying they are perfect, but they work

CONTENTS:
scan.js     - scans a T1 site for scripts (ded npcs)

c.js        - attempts to hack l0cket and c00x
e.js        - attempts to hack EZ_xx
hx.js       - call this and it will try to unlock all locks in succession

scripts.txt - (optional) copy & paste the found scripts in here 
autohx.au3  - (optional) AutoIt script for easy hacking (just press F4 after you enter hardline)


INSTRUCTIONS:

 1) I recommend making two macros:
/scan = scan {{  t:#s.{0} }}
/hx = hx {{ t:#s.{0} }}

2) Use as such:
/scan tandoori.public
/hx anonymous_mrcbap.pub_info_0j8cpu

3) (optional)
A - Copy and paste found scripts in the scripts.txt file
B - Someow get AutoIt (and hope my years old version is compatible with what you get) and just run the script, it will switch to hackmud (or any window that has hackmud in it..) and then you can just keep pressing F





Note: I haven't played in a while and doing this by heart so it might be a little different.. but hey thats what the game is all about
