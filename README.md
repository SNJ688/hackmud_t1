# hackmud_t1
T1 hackmud scripts

I'm not saying they are perfect, but they work

INSTRUCTIONS:

use the command hx as such:
hx {t:#s.name.script}

I recommend making a macro like: /hx = hx {{ t:#s.{0} }}





Note: I haven't played in a while and doing this by heart so it might be a little different..
